 * Notes:
 *     CS239 KBS Coursework: minimax and alpha-beta pruning. This code
 *     is deliberately minimally commented, written for simplicity,
 *     and does not always follow good coding practise. However, it
 *     should be very easy to follow if you understand minimax
 *     and alpha-beta pruning. Loosely based on code by Ravi Mohan.
